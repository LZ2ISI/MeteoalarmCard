## How to add translations

We are currently looking to implement more languages to MeteoalarmCard. If you are able to add or improve translations in language you speak don't hastate to make a PR.

**Notes about current translation keys**
- `editor.disable_swiper` - If there is not a good translation for *swiper* you can keep this word untranslated.
- `editor.description` - These keys are used to generate helpful description for users selecting entities. Please make sure they sound correctly in all combinations. The formula is `start + any middle key + end`
- `editor.description.warning_watch_statement_advisory` - If there is not a good translation for words (*warning, watch, statement*, *advisory*) you can keep these words untranslated.

**If you want to improve existing translation:**
1. Follow the [setup guide](#setup-local-environment) and [contributing guide](#how-to-contribute)
2. Modify the language file in the `src/localize/languages` directory
3. Remember that key that are not yet translated have `null` instead of the string. Please replace them with translated
messages.
1. Open a Pull Request.

**If you want to create a new translation:**
1. Follow the [setup guide](#setup-local-environment) and [contributing guide](#how-to-contribute)
1. Copy `src/localize/languages/en.json` file and name it with appropriate language code.
1. Translate only the keys (second quotation mark).
1. Import your translation in `src/localize/localize.ts` file.
1. Mention your translation in `README.md` file (list should be sorted alphabetically).
